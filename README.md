# Traveller's Tavern

Traveller's Tavern is an online multiplayer game based on the board game [Red Dragon Inn](https://slugfestgames.com/rdifamily/) in which players assume the identities of characters at an tavern after a long journey's end. Each player aims to be the last one standing and sober at the tavern by using their character's unique card deck to get other characters so weak, intoxicated, or bankrupt that they must leave the tavern.

## Currently in the works:

At the moment, the following pieces of this program are in the works:

- A complete model of the game and appropriate game objects.
- An asynchronous, non-networked API through which a game can be initiated and played. This API will allow for any networked or non-networked controller to be constructed and easily hooked up to the game, such as a multiplayer game via only the local machine or a controller that allows for online play.

## Future planned updates:

Upon completion of the previous program segments, the following updates are planned:

- An online multiplayer game controller that allows one player to initiate and run the game and other players to join via remote devices.
- A backend updating GUI through which to easily add new cards and characters as well as push new updates.
